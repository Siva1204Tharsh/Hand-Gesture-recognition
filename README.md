# Hand Gesture Recognition
* Human gestures include different components of 
visual actions such as motion of hands, facial 
expression, and torso, to convey meaning. So far, in the 
field of gesture recognition, most previous works have 
focused on the manual component of gestures.
* A hand gesture recognition system provide a natural, 
innovative and modern way of non verbal 
communication. It has a wide area of application in 
human computer interaction and sign language
